<h3>For my website I used CherryPy along with HTML, CSS, Jinja and a bit of JavaScript.</h3>
- CherryPy was used as a skeleton for my webpages, so I can serve team easily to the Python webserver<br><br>
- Jinja2 was used to easily load my webpages into cherrypy functions by using the template environment it offers<br><br>
- HTML stands at the core of the website, being used to design the webpages<br><br>
- CSS was used for the styling of the different html elements and also to make my Navbar stick to the screen
when scrolling<br><br>
- JavaScript was used only to create a script for my NavBar buttons in order to make them active/inactive, so that
the user is shown on which page he currently is on<br><br>
The website has a section about Natural Treatments for most common health issues, a Food section in which you can find
all sorts of healthy food, and a Documentation section in which I present documentation for my website and android
application<br><br>
A public link to the website can be found here(without the documentation):<a href="https://ofeliedeceai.github

<h3>For my Android application I used Java + XML and a lot of imports.</h3>
- Java was the main part of the project, being used for my MainActivity and ChatMessage classes. The
MainActivity class is the one that drives the whole application, by checking for user sign in status, displaying the
start page, the chat window, the sign out menu and also the input box and send button. The ChatMessage class holds
all information of a chat message: the username, text, date and time it was sent.
<br><br>
- XML was used for the design of my app. I used an activity_main.xml, for the start page of the app, message.xml for
designing the chat window and a small main_menu.xml to design a simple Log Out menu<br><br>
My application uses an Email/Password authentication method, so when the user first starts the app, the app
checks if the user already has an account by calling the FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser() functions. If
the user is not signed in, they will be prompted to either enter an existing account or create a new one. After the
user signs in the application, they are now sent to the chat window. Here they can type a message and tap the
FloatingActionButton(FAB) in order to send it. A message has a username and an exact date of when it was sent.
The user can also opt to sign out by tapping the 3 dots in the top-right corner of the screen and then 'Sign Out'.
The app will close when the user Signs Out. More users can chat together if they all have this app installed.
